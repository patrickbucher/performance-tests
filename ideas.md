- typical inefficiencies
  - regexp compilation within loop
  - find in array instead of map lookup
  - building differences from arrays instead of using sets
  - different ways of shuffling an array
- Fibonacci numbers
  - recursive algorithm
  - recursive algorithm with memoization
  - loop
- prime numbers
  - finding prime numbers
  - factorizing numbers - interleaved with iterator for finding prime numbers
  - sieve of eratosthenes
- order of iteration
  - search for duplicates in array
    - compare each value to each other value
    - use a set and compare length to original array
